## Background 
For this project we were assigned to a tell story centered around data visualisations, focusing on providing users with an interactive experience to explore the datasets for themselves. 

We went left field with our topic. Inspired by several team members love of food we settled on "An Analysis into the economic growth/impact of Avocados".  

## Programs Used
d3, d3.json, Plotly, DROPDOWN,  SQL, MongoDB, JQuery, CSS, Bootstrap

## Datasets

## Graph Analyses
### Sales

Trends of Datasets: 
The majority of sales come from small/medium and bulk GTIN units. There is a seasonal trend (upward/downward wave movements)
Small/medium units peaked nearly the entire 2020 period.

Software Used: 
D3, json, MongoDB  

Limitations: 
Lack of detail on the small/medium units in a much bigger depth (they are combined), making it harder to understand the difference.

### Volume

Trends of Datasets: 
Mexico has the highest volume of avocado through the 2-and-a-half year period.
California has a higher volume of avocados at the middle of the years 2020 and 2021, but none in 2022.
Three different countries (Chile, Peru, Dominican Republic) have a volume of avocados only a certain period of time (plenty of zeros).

Software Used: 
D3, json, MongoDB

Limitations: 
A small number of countries available -  indicating issues in details on the global situation of the volume of avocados.
There is some difficulty in finding data from a variety of countries.
Lack of understanding on the type of avocados that are sold (hass or original).

### Competition

Trends of Datasets: 
Data heavily skewed towards Mexico & California in early 2020. 
Roughly 98% of all Avocados exported. 
Progressively becoming  
South American countries exporting significantly more Hass Avocados, than Organic. 
99:1 ratio most dates. 
90:10 in California 

Software Used: 
d3. json, Plotly,  DROPDOWN , MongoDB

Limitations: 
Disproportionate dataset. 
Given the small number of countries, decided to go with a Plotly bar graph over Leaflet. 
Mexico often consisted of 70-80% of total amount of Avocados.  California: 15-20% 
From 124 weekly dropdown bar graphs. 

Dataset only lists whether the Avocados are Organic or Hass varieties
More than 500+ confirmed types of Avocados.
 

### Pricing
Trends of Datasets: 
Southern States (eg: Georgia, Texas) generally had higher total units exported, and lower average prices. 
Northern states generally had lower total units,  (Massachusetts, Illinois), and higher average prices   (Freight costs)
Higher populated states had higher units exported (eg: Texas)

Software Used: 
d3, json 

Limitations: 
Cannot verify what time of year Avocados are the most expensive based on the graph 
Limited data supplied for New York state, most populated of 50 states. 
Too many data points.
